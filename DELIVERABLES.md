# DELIVERABLES.md

The given assignment requires us to develop a simulation for an agent which shows reactive and proactive behaviours of agents. 

We shall also show planning, scheduling, and learning algorithms, and a comprehensive analysis of various implementation and design choices, and their implications within the scope of the project.

# OVERVIEW

We have implemented the following deliverables within the scope of our project:
1. A realistic map of IIT Jodhpur with ~1000 walls, ~150 different locations and ~50 different buildings
2. catkin workspace for our ros-noetic package, containing a package for loading a robot onto the IIT Jodhpur map
3. scenario 1: A tour guide for a robot that can show visitors all the important buildings inside IIT Jodhpur and pause/resume touring at any time.
4. scenario 2: A delivery agent from main gate to any location on campus.
5. scenario 3: Navigation within inaccessible environment.

The following deliverables need to be submitted by the deadline of the final phase:

## 1. The complete code for the project

## 2. Project report
- The project undertaken and the features implemented
- Tools/ libraries used, with purpose.
- Detailed design
- The experimental results and analysis (most important)

## 3. Demo
A part of the offline presentation and evaluation. Should highlight functionality and implementation details of the virtual scenarios.
